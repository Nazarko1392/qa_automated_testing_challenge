# Task 1: Software configuration.
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

>   Hello! My name is **[Nazar](https://www.instagram.com/nazarko1392/)**. 
    I'm a **Manual Quality Assurance** engineer.
    Recently, I began to think about starting to study **Automated Testing**.
    I believe that I'm lucky coz I saw an ad for your courses on Instagram.
    I'm located in Poland and this is a chance to get the necessary basic knowledge of test automation, improve my skills, 
    set up communication with new people and get an interview at a Polish IT company.
    With best regards!
